  <h2 align="center">QuotiePie - A slice of inspiration</h2>


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Info : 
**QuotiePie** is an app that displays a random inspirational quote to help users start their day or stay motivated. It is built to demonstrate the use of Modern Android development (MAD) tools , based on MVVM Clean Architecture & Jetpack compose. App is mainly divided into 3 layers i.e ```data```, ```domain``` & ```app``` (presentation).
It also showcase the implemetation of some of the Modern Jetpack Architecture Component.

## Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
  - [Koin](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Koin is a smart Kotlin dependency injection library to keep you focused on your app, not on your tools. **This is in the [main branch](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin)**.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) - For writing Gradle build scripts using Kotlin.

## üß∞ Other Tools :
* [Kotlin DSL][7] : For writing gradle script for Kotlin is more readable and offers better compile-time.
* [Version Catalog][8] : Declaring gradle dependencies & plugins in central place.
* [Github Actions(CI/CD)][9] : Automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline through Github Actions.
* [Renovate][10] : To keep the app dependencies up-tp-date automatically.

## üèóÔ∏è App Architecture :
App is build using Clean Architecture design pattern. Which consist of three module as follows :
* [**app**](https://github.com/guerbejhamdi/QuotiePie-Android/tree/master/app) - This module is responsible for handling user interaction, displaying data and managing user interface. Usually this module is decoupled from bossiness logic and communicate with domain module for accessing any data.
* [**domain**](https://github.com/guerbejhamdi/QuotiePie-Android/tree/master/domain) - In this module contains core bussiness logic and it doesn't contains any platform related api usage and should only use java/kotlin language apis.
* [**data**](https://github.com/guerbejhamdi/QuotiePie-Android/tree/master/data) - This module is mainly responsible for accessing data from remote or local source which is being called from domain module only.
